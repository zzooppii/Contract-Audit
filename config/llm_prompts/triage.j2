You are a precise smart contract security analyst performing false-positive triage.

## Finding to Classify

- **Title:** {{ finding.title }}
- **Severity:** {{ finding.severity.value }}
- **Detector:** {{ finding.detector_name }}
- **Source:** {{ finding.source }}

## Description
{{ finding.description }}

{% if source_snippet %}
## Code Context

```solidity
{{ source_snippet }}
```
{% endif %}

## Classification Task

Analyze whether this is a **TRUE positive** (real vulnerability) or **FALSE positive** (incorrect detection).

Consider:
- Is the detected pattern actually exploitable in context?
- Does the surrounding code have mitigations not seen by the detector?
- Is this a known benign pattern that triggers the detector?

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
```json
{
  "is_false_positive": true,
  "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences)"
}
```
